Exalted Ironbride is not going to match 1:1 with Arquebex, but that doesn’t mean Ironbride (or the rest of her kit) should be overshadowed.

When the target is thrown the Damage dealt is a percentage of the target's current Health.\nBoth of these changes help to scale Meathook with varying enemy levels.\nBonewidow Necramech can now reflect damage while blocking with Shield Maiden (this is exclusive to the player’s version of Bonewidow).\nBonewidow will now absorb enemy attacks for a few seconds after activating Shield Maiden, and the absorbed damage will be added to the shield’s Health.\nEnemy Bonewidow Shield Maiden now has a limited amount of Health and can be destroyed.\nEnemy Bonewidow will no longer reattach her arm while wielding Exalted Ironbride. One thing at a time! \nRemoved Ammo UI when Bonewidow is wielding Ironbride. \nFixed a crash when using Bonewidow’s Meathook on a Deimos Mitosid.\nFixed Bonewidow’s Shield Maiden not deactivating upon Transferring out/back in. This resulted in your shield being on your chest (not active). However, when you pressed Melee you would do Maiden’s Kiss, and it would cost Energy, instead of the normal Necramech unarmed attack.\nFixed Bonewidow’s Firing Line affecting Companions/Pets.\nFixed Bonewidow’s Firing Line ragdolling you.\nFixed enemy Bonewidow sometimes getting stuck with Ironbride out and being unable to switch back to its gun.\nFixed Bonewidow Melee attacking while using Shield Maiden (Maiden’s Kiss attack) would show Atlas' Landslide ability pop-up text.\nFixed Bonewidow’s Firing Line animation not matching its current shield state correctly. \nFixed Bonewidow’s rear hit box getting hit from front attacks.\nFixed Bonewidow visual-only \"Ability Use Prevented\" problem after toggling Shield Maiden and Ironbride off.\nFixed enemy Bonewidows not knowing how to initiate a Maiden’s Kiss.

This also fixes a related issue where Ironbride would only execute the first attack in its combo chain instead of the full loop. \nFixed an issue with Bonewidow’s Shield Maiden blocking bounds becoming very small when attacked. This was causing Bonewidow to take damage instead of the shield.\nFixed Bonewidow’s Meathook not properly skewering the target if done by a Client player. Previously the ragdoll would appear to float around.\nFixed enemies held by Bonewidow’s Meathook able to cast abilities.\nFixed Bonewidow’s Meathook not displaying \"Not Enough Energy\" UI message.\nFixed enemies on Bonewidows Meathook teleporting to their last known spot instead of just being dropped when activating Shield Maiden at the same time.\nEnemy Necramechs (Voidrig & Bonewidow) will now rotate its body to indicate that it is about to slide towards you. \nFixed cases where both Voidrig and Bonewidow wouldn’t attack with its currently equipped weapon.\nExtended context action range of the Bait console when grabbing the key during an Isolation Vault Bounty to help prevent sliding past it or standing on top of it.\nRunning out of Railjack Boost stamina will now clear the Boost state to address Boost not recharging once depleted.

Also, with the addition of the new Isolation Vault Bounties, the time it may take squads/solo players to complete them all could exceed the Vome/Fass cycles.\nScintillants have a chance to respawn in Isolation Vault Bounties.\nThe new Isolation Vault Bounties bring you back through the previously completed Vaults and further into the Underground. Having Scintillant respawn grants another kick at the can even if Scintillant was already found in a Vault. \nEsophages in Isolation Vault Bounties now have a press and hold context action to avoid accidentally interacting, and thus having to go all the way back down to do the Vault Generators.\nRebalanced enemy Voidrig (and the upcoming Bonewidow) Isolation Vault fights for a more fair experience that embraces the precedent set with Kuva Liches:\n*Enemy Voidrig & Bonewidow Necramechs now have the ‘Lich’ treatment with vulnerability to Status Effects, meaning you can now apply Status Effects to Necramechs! Additionally, certain damage immunities and diminishing returns for Warframe abilities have been added to balance this out. \nThe damage immunities apply to movement abilities, such as Banshee’s Sonic Boom, to prevent yeeting the Necramech into the sun. The diminishing returns are present to also prevent 1HKOs \nIncreased the cooldown time when the Voidrig (and Bonewidow) cast their invulnerability shield while in their “armless” phase. \nNew Isolation Vault Bounties also have 3 new encounter types within the Bounty!\nThis fearsome Necramech, fashioned in honor of the Entrati matriarch, is a robust front-line fighter.

Previously known as “Splitter,” the clever Mitosid splits in twain to divide and conquer as the Diploid. Both the Basal and Feral Diploid make up for what they lack in maneuverability with what they have in appendages!\nWe’ve increased the Shared Affinity Range in Free Roam missions from 50 meters to 250 meters! When implementing the change to make Necramech’s level up to 40, it prompted the conversation of Necramech leveling and its restriction to Free Roam missions. With the addition of Bonewidow, it felt appropriate to dial the Shared Affinity Range up for these much larger tilesets. While it’s always ideal to stick together, we hope the 250 meter range allows you to both level up your Necramech faster and venture a bit farther in the landscape.\n*Necramechs (Bonewidow and Voidrig) now have a built-in vacuum!\nWith the introduction of the newest Bounties, we reviewed Obelisk spawn sites and saw that they were occupying vacant sites that we felt would be better used for new Bounty objectives! These sites were also difficult for enemies to maneuver and access, and they would often get stuck in the Obelisk shards.\nA version of the Mutalist Cernos Bow, each arrow spawns a swarm of sticky appendages on impact.

				"changes": "Resource Drop Chance Boosters now apply to Steel Essence and Riven Sliver drops within Steel Path missions.\nTo confirm player theories and clarify, previous to this Hotfix Resource Drop Chance Boosters did not affect Steel Essence or Riven Sliver drops in The Steel Path. It was not our intention to hide or subvert that information in game, and we should have clarified more quickly that this was the case.\nbut ultimately we are all hands on deck working to make Heart of Deimos the best it can be for August 25th. As of this Hotfix, any Tenno who have already walked The Steel Path will receive a Resource Drop Chance Booster.\nThis Hotfix ensures that Resource Drop Chance Boosters work within The Steel Path for Riven Slivers and Steel Essence. They were initially turned off to ensure the inherent Steel Path Resource Drop Chance Booster worked as intended. Like the initial Arcane Marketplace in Scarlet Spear, we wanted to ensure the automatic ‘100% Steel Path Resource Drop Chance Booster’ didn’t unintentionally scale for Resources specific to the Steel Path (Riven Slivers and Steel Essence). This unfortunately also affected player obtained reward Resource Drop Chance Boosters.\nIvara’s Artemis Bow now has 20% Status Chance per projectile. Also slightly tweaked how Status Chance and Multishot are displayed in Arsenal stats.",
